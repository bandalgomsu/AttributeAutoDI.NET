# AttributeAutoDI

> üåü Attribute-based automatic dependency injection library for .NET

---
## Nuget
>

## üí° Motivation
The default DI container in ASP.NET Core is simple and powerful,
but having to call builder.Services.AddXXX<>() repeatedly introduces a few pain points:

‚ùå The more services you implement, the longer and harder your Program.cs becomes to manage

‚ùå Handling multiple implementations of the same interface requires verbose, error-prone registration

‚ùå Service intent is not self-explanatory ‚Äì registration and class definition are separated

üëâ What if... classes could declare how they want to be injected?
AttributeAutoDI was born from this idea.

It is built on the following principles:
‚úÖ Services should declare their own lifecycle and purpose

‚úÖ Multiple implementations should be clearly handled via [Primary] or [Named]

‚úÖ We should reduce boilerplate code in Program.cs without sacrificing readability

> Our goal is to simplify Program.cs and Startup.cs as much as possible
so you can trust the system to "just work."

---

## üßæ  Requirements

- .NET 6.0 or later
- Compatible with Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection (ASP.NET Core, Console apps, etc.)

---

## üî• Features

‚úÖ Automatic registration via [Singleton], [Scoped], and [Transient]

‚≠ê [Primary] support for selecting default implementation

üè∑Ô∏è [Named] support for explicit injection via constructor parameters

üõ†Ô∏è [Options("Section")] for automatic configuration binding

---

## üöÄ Usage

### 1. Register the extension
```jsx
builder.Services.AddAttributeDependencyInjection(builder.Configuration);
```
or
```jsx
builder.Services.AddAttributeDependencyInjection(builder.Configuration,typeof(Program).Assembly);
```
Internally, it expands to:

```jsx
public static class AttributeInjectionExtension
{
    public static void AddAttributeDependencyInjection(
    this IServiceCollection services,
    IConfiguration configuration,
    Assembly? assembly = null
)
{
    assembly ??= Assembly.GetEntryAssembly();

    services.UseOptionsBindingInjection(configuration, assembly);
    services.UseAttributeInjection(assembly);
    services.UsePrimaryInjection();
    services.UseNameParameterInjection(assembly);
    services.Replace(ServiceDescriptor.Transient<IControllerActivator, NamedControllerActivator>());
}
```
### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Register in correct order!
‚úîÔ∏è This works as expected:
```jsx
builder.Service.AddSingleton...
builder.Service.AddAttributeDependencyInjection 
```
‚ùå This may not work correctly:
```jsx
builder.Service.AddAttributeDependencyInjection
builder.Service.AddSingleton...
```
If you use both manual and attribute-based registration, always call AddAttributeDependencyInjection() after manual registrations.

### 2. Attribute-based Auto registration - [Singleton], [Transient], [Scoped]

```jsx
[Singleton]
public class MyService : IMyService
{
    public string Get() => "hello";
}
```
This is equivalent to:
```jsx
builder.Services.AddSingleton<IMyService, MyService>();
```

### 3. Primary service selection - [Primary]
```jsx

[Singleton]
public class MyService : IMyService
{
    public string Get() => "hello";
}

[Primary]
[Singleton]
public class MyPrimaryService : IMyService
{
    public string Get() => "I am primary";
}
```
When injecting IMyService, the system will prefer MyPrimaryService.

### 4. Named injection - [Named]

```jsx
[Singleton]
public class MyService : IMyService
{
    public string Get() => "hello";
}
```
This will register myService (default camel-case name).
Or set custom name:

```jsx
[Singleton("myNamedService")]
public class MyService : IMyService
{
    public string Get() => "hello";
}
```
Then inject with:

```jsx
[Singleton]
public class TestFacade([Named("myNamedService")]IMyservice myservice)
{
...
}
// myservice == MyService
```
Named injection works in registered Class

### 5. Options binding via attribute - [Options]
```jsx
[Options("Sample:Sample")]
public class SampleOption
{
    public string Sample { get; set; } = "";
}
```
This is equivalent to:

```jsx
builder.Services.Configure<SampleOption>(configuration.GetSection("Sample:Sample"));
```
Then you can inject it with:

```jsx
public class SampleController(
    IOptions<SampleOption> sampleOption) ...
```
